</Info>

Follow these steps to install and run RZ Autoparks on your system:

**Step 1**: Clone the repository:

```php
git clone https://github.com/a89s/RZ-Autoparks.git
```

**Step 2**: Run:

```php
composer install
```

**Step 3**: Run:

```php
npm install
```

**Step 4**: Run:

```php
cp .env.example .env
```

**Step 5**: Update the DB settings:

```php
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=db_name
DB_USERNAME=db_username
DB_PASSWORD=db_password
```

**Step 6**: Run the app's backend:

```php
php artisan serve
```

**Step 7**: Run the app's frontend:

```php
npm run dev
```

### Custom Ports

By default, app uses port 3000. You can customize the port app runs on by using the `--port` flag. To run app on port 8090, for instance, use this command:

```php
php artisan serve --port 8090
```

If you attempt to run app on a port that's already in use, it will use the next available port:

```md
Port 3000 is already in use. Trying 3001 instead.
```

## Validating Links

The CLI can assist with validating reference links made in your documentation. To identify any broken links, use the following command:

```bash
mintlify broken-links
```

## Deployment

<Tip>
  Unlimited editors available under the [Pro
  Plan](https://mintlify.com/pricing) and above.
</Tip>

If the deployment is successful, you should see the following:

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/checks-passed.png"
    style={{ borderRadius:"0.5rem" }}
  />
</Frame>

## Code Formatting

We suggest using extensions on your IDE to recognize and format MDX. If you're a VSCode user, consider the [MDX VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=unifiedjs.vscode-mdx) for syntax highlighting, and [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) for code formatting.
