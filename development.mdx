## Installing
<Info>
  **Prerequisite**: Please install PHP 8.3 (or higher), Composer, MySql before proceeding.
</Info>

Follow these steps to install and run RZ Autoparks app on your system:

**Step 1**: Clone the repository:

```php
git clone https://github.com/a89s/RZ-Autoparks.git
```

**Step 2**: Run:

```php
composer install
```

**Step 3**: Run:

```php
npm install
```

**Step 4**: Run:

```php
cp .env.example .env
```

**Step 5**: Update the DB settings:

```php
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=db_name
DB_USERNAME=db_username
DB_PASSWORD=db_password
```

**Step 6**: Run the app's backend:

```php
php artisan serve
```

**Step 7**: Run the app's frontend:

```php
npm run dev
```

## Custom Ports

By default, app uses port 3000. You can customize the port app runs on by using the `--port` flag. To run app on port 8090, for instance, use this command:

```php
php artisan serve --port 8090
```

If you attempt to run app on a port that's already in use, it will use the next available port:

```md
Port 3000 is already in use. Trying 3001 instead.
```

## Deployment

<Tip>
  There is a branch named **DEV** that is used for development purposes. Ideally for each feature you build, you would make a new branch so that it's easier to follow changes and fix stuff if something is broken.\
  \
  P.S. - We use [Code Rabbit ](https://www.coderabbit.ai/)for PR's. Makes our lives a bit easier. It explains the PR with sequence diagrams and other stuff.
</Tip>

If the deployment is successful, you should see the following:

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/coderabbit.webp"
    style={{ borderRadius:"0.5rem" }}
    alt=""
    title=""
  />
</Frame>

## Code Formatting

We use Laravel Pint for code formatting. It is integrated in our CI/CD checks. There will be a new section explaining this.
